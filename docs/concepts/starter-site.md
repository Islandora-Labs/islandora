# Islandora Starter Site

The Islandora Starter Site is a complete exported Drupal site, that includes the Islandora modules and 
configures them in a way that is illustrative and useful. It is intended to be a starting point for
 site builders, who are encouraged to modify, add, and remove any components or features that are not desired.

To work fully, the Islandora Starter Site requires access to external services such as Solr,
Fedora, Alpaca, and Matomo. It is therefore suggested to deploy the Starter Site using one of our 
two deployment platforms: ISLE-DC (using the `make starter` or `make starter_dev` commands), or
the Islandora Playbook (using the default `starter` or `starter_dev` option in the Vagrantfile).
