To test out Islandora, there is [a Starter-Site based demo available]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LrIe12eYAZjD4A8_cqf61RXv7mtMJRHH/view?usp=share_lin](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/installation/install-a-demo/) (Download the .zip file). It is loaded with sample content to demonstrate
features of Islandora and provide a starting point for exploration. Follow the instructions in the README.md.html file provided in the download.

It is recommended that you have a minimum of 4GB of hard drive space available on your machine before getting started. It will take some time to build the image, do not be surprised if it takes a long time. Thanks, and happy building!
