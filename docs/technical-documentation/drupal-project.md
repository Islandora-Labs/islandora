# Introduction

Islandora makes use of [drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project), a composer template for Drupal projects. We augment it with Islandora specific changes, and need to occasionally pull in upstream changes. The process below outlines how we will do it in a consistent manner.

# Pull in upstream changes

1. Clone a fork of our fork to your or your institution's GitHub organization:
<br />  `git clone fork`
2. Add the drupal-composer repository as a remote:
<br /> `git remote add upstream https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project.git`
3. Fetch everything:
<br /> `git fetch --all`
4. Create a branch to pull in changes that is based off the Islandora 8.x-1.x branch:
<br /> `git checkout -b sync-upstream`
5. Rebase upstream changes:
<br /> `git rebase upstream/8.x` (fix any merge conflicts, and then `git rebase --continue`)
6. Push to your fork:
<br /> `git push origin sync-upstream`
7. Create pull request
